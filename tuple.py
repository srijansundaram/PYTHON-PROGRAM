# Creating a tuple using()

t = (1, 2, 4, 5)
# t1 = () # empty tuple
# t1 = (1) # this is wrong. we cannot make tuple with single element like this.
# t1 = (1,) # this is right way to make tuple with single element.
# print(t1)
# printing the elements of tuple
# print(t)

# We cannot update the values of tuple.
# t[0]= 34 --> doesn't work
